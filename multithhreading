Java Multithreading and Concurrency – Complete Roadmap


---

1. Fundamentals – Core Concepts

1. Thread Lifecycle
States: New → Runnable → Running → Waiting → Timed Waiting → Blocked → Terminated
Key methods: start(), run(), sleep(), wait(), notify(), join()

2. JVM Thread Scheduler
Decides which thread runs, based on OS-level preemptive scheduling
Thread priorities (setPriority()) exist but not guaranteed
Difference between Daemon and User threads

3. Thread Creation
Extending Thread class
Implementing Runnable interface
Using Callable<V> for returning values or throwing checked exceptions

---

2. Synchronization and Locking

1. Synchronization Basics
synchronized block/method → intrinsic or object-level lock
Object lock vs Class-level lock
synchronized is reentrant (same thread can re-acquire lock)


2. Wait and Notify Mechanism
Methods: wait(), notify(), notifyAll()
Must be called inside a synchronized block
Common example: Producer–Consumer implementation


3. Volatile Keyword
Ensures visibility of changes across threads (not atomicity)
Establishes a “happens-before” relationship between write and read operations


4. Deadlock, Starvation, and Immutability
Deadlock: circular dependency on locks
Starvation: low-priority thread never gets CPU time
Immutability: ensures thread safety without synchronization

---

3. Modern Concurrency Utilities (java.util.concurrent)

1. Executor Framework
Replaces manual thread creation
Core interfaces: Executor, ExecutorService, ScheduledExecutorService
Common methods: submit(), invokeAll(), invokeAny(), shutdown()

Thread pool types:
newFixedThreadPool()
newCachedThreadPool()
newSingleThreadExecutor()
newScheduledThreadPool()
Benefits: thread reuse, better resource management, controlled parallelism


2. Future and CompletableFuture

Future.get() blocks until completion
CompletableFuture provides non-blocking async operations
Common methods: supplyAsync(), thenApply(), thenCombine(), thenAccept(), exceptionally()
Useful for async task chaining (e.g., payment → inventory → email)


3. Callable vs Runnable
Runnable: no return value, cannot throw checked exceptions
Callable: returns a result and supports checked exceptions

---

4. Thread Pools and Parallelism

1. Thread Pool Implementation
Implemented using ThreadPoolExecutor
Important parameters: core size, max size, queue type, rejection policy
Benefits: predictable performance, resource efficiency

2. Scheduled Threads
ScheduledExecutorService is used for recurring or delayed tasks

3. Fork–Join Framework
Introduced in Java 7 for divide-and-conquer parallelism
Key classes: RecursiveTask, RecursiveAction

---

5. Advanced Concurrency Data Structures

1. ConcurrentHashMap
Java 7: segmented locking; Java 8+: CAS-based locking
Allows multiple threads to work safely in parallel
Compared to Hashtable (single global lock) and synchronizedMap() (method-level sync)
Typical use cases: shared caching, counters, analytics


2. BlockingQueue
Common implementations: ArrayBlockingQueue, LinkedBlockingQueue
Used in Producer–Consumer design
Provides thread-safe put() and take() without explicit wait/notify
ArrayBlockingQueue → bounded queue, predictable capacity
LinkedBlockingQueue → optionally bounded, higher throughput


3. Fail-safe Iterator
Does not throw ConcurrentModificationException
Example: ConcurrentHashMap iterator (vs fail-fast iterator of HashMap)

---

6. Synchronization Utilities

1. CountDownLatch

Used to make a thread wait until other threads finish (one-time use)


2. CyclicBarrier

All threads wait at a common barrier point before proceeding (reusable)


3. Semaphore

Controls the number of threads accessing a shared resource


4. CAS (Compare and Set)

Non-blocking synchronization used internally in Atomic classes


5. Atomic Classes

Examples: AtomicInteger, AtomicBoolean, AtomicReference

Use CAS internally for thread-safe, lock-free updates



---

7. Practical Scenarios and Patterns

1. Producer–Consumer Pattern

Implement using wait/notify (traditional way) or BlockingQueue (modern way)


2. Object Pool Pattern

Maintains reusable objects like threads or DB connections to reduce creation cost


3. Parallel / Pipeline Processing

Achieved using ExecutorService or CompletableFuture chaining


4. Common Business Use Cases

Asynchronous APIs (payment → inventory → email)

Background tasks using thread pools

Concurrent caches with ConcurrentHashMap

Coordinating tasks with CountDownLatch or CyclicBarrier



---

8. Coding Scenarios for Interviews

Q1. Given a list of integers and number of threads → add 1 to each element using ExecutorService or ForkJoinPool.

Q2. Implement order placement using CompletableFuture
Steps: initiatePayment → updateInventory → sendEmail
Demonstrate async composition with error handling
